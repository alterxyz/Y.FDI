## Design

### Features

#### Feature Raw

Those raw feature requests come from various sources, including GitHub issues, Discord messages, emails, and internal discussions.

#### Feature Refined / Ready to Develop (meta feature base)

The refined features are the result of the feature extraction process. They are stored in the vector database for storage and search, also recorded in the simple database for backup and other purposes.

A raw data may or may not link to various meta features - for a implementation, it is normal to have multiple way to achieve the same goal.

### Development
